        <p>Hello! I am a student studying User Interface Design. I graduate in December, which is also when I get married! In the future I hope to work as a designer at an in-house department. I love making things useable and organizing information in an apporacheable visual way. </p>
        <p>This class is going to help me understand the function of websites better. This will hopefully improve my communication with web developers and help smooth the workflow between designing and building sites.</p>
