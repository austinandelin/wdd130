        Red Rabbit Identity
Branding/Identity Design, Advertising
The Red Rabbit Grill is an all-ages restaurant in Rexburg, Idaho. Founded in 2017, Red Rabbit seeks to cultivate a positive and casual social environment for friends, family, and peers to meet and enjoy great food. It has largely succeeded, becoming a well-known spot in town to share significant moments at with loved ones.

Strategy
A brand was developed to refocus on what made The Red Rabbit Grill unique: The special blend of down-to-earth approachability and memory-making quality. To this end I chose to center the rough-cut wood that is on the walls of the restaurant, which perfectly encapsulates the character of Red Rabbit.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I grew up on a family farm in Northern Nevada. From a young age I learned that good produce takes time and care to flourish. Now I apply the same patience and passion towards making design work that truly excels.
